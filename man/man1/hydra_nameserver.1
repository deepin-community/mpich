.SH NAME
hydra_nameserver \-  program to support MPI
.I s name publishing features with hydra 
.SH DESCRIPTION
Hydra is the default name service for MPI\\
s name publishing features
(MPI_PUBLISH_NAME/MPI_LOOKUP_NAME). For programs launched by separate
hydra instances, a separate nameserver mechanism need be launched in
order for the name publishing to work across multiple process managers.

This can be achieved with hydra_nameserver. For example:
.nf
shell@myhost1$ hydra_nameserver &
shell@myhost1$ mpiexec -hosts myhost1,myhost2 -n 4 -nameserver myhost1 ./a.out
.fi
